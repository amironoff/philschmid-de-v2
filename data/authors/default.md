Hello, my name is Philipp. I am 26 years old living in Nuremberg, Germany.

Currently I am working as a Technical Lead at Hugging Face to democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.

I am leading our collaboration and partnership with AWS and responsible for our new Inference Solution 🤗 Infinity.

In the past I designed and implemented cloud-native machine learning architectures for fin-tech and insurance companies.

In June 2021 I became the first German AWS Machine Learning Hero.

I found my passion for cloud concepts and machine learning 5 years ago. Since then I never stopped learning. Currently, I am focusing myself in the area NLP and how to leverage models like BERT, Roberta and GPT2 to generate business value.

I love to design solution oriented, scalable, efficient architectures to solve real business problems. I believe that machine learning can support any company in any area at any time.

I created this blog to share my knowledge and connect with people. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter or via email.
